# pokecord-autocatcher
The fastest &amp; completely free to use pokecord autocatcher.
# What's different?
Unlike my old one, this does not use google which makes it 10x faster.
<br>
I also now have a discord for this... you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/7t4FVJv">here</a> but be warned you may be seen as someone with a selfbot.
# Can i get banned?
Only if you modify the script.
<br>
Also, don't brag about having a selfbot & you'll be fine.
<br>
(If a message contains something along the lines of i.e. "i have a selfbot" etc. you can be reported.)
# Installation & how it works
<ul>
  <li>Create a folder for this project on your system.</li>
  <li>Download this project however way you like.</li>
  <li>Drop the files into the folder. (easy access)</li>
  <li>Install node.js... <a href="https://nodejs.org">Windows etc</a> or <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md">Ubuntu</a> (to execute/run the script)</li>
  <li>Install <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/">discord.js</a> using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/31930422">NPM</a> (to make the script a discord bot.)</li>
  (NPM comes with node.js, it's used to install packages for node.)
  <br>
  <li>Install <a href="http://unirest.io/nodejs.html">Unirest</a> with NPM (to GET the spawn image from discord)</li>
  <li>Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/crc">CRC</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-crc">node-CRC</a> (to make spawn image into a value the script can use to identify or compare.)</li>
  (you can install either CRC, i provided options cause one may not install on your system.)
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1lzqzLQCs">Get your discord token.</a> (Script will login as you when ran.)
  <li>Edit the config file to your liking. (put your token in here.)</li>
  <li>Next if you're on windows open command prompt to the location of the folder.</li>
  (If you're on ubuntu skip this step above.)
  <li>Enter the following command <pre>node autocatcher</pre></li>
  <li>If you want to stop the bot/script do CTRL+C</li>
  (if you're on ubuntu i recommend using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen">screen</a> to create a session for the script, this will make it run 24/7)
</ul>
